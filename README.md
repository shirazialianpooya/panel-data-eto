## ðŸ“– Abstract
Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) plays a crucial role in hydrology, irrigation planning, and climate studies.  
In this work, we apply **panel data econometric techniques** to estimate ETo across multiple stations and time periods.  
The approach improves estimation accuracy by accounting for both spatial and temporal variability.
