## üìñ Overview
Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a key parameter in hydrology, irrigation scheduling, and climate impact studies.  
This project explores the use of **panel data econometric techniques** to improve the estimation of ETo by leveraging both spatial (across stations) and temporal (across time) dimensions.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This repository is a **work in progress**. Code, data, and structure are subject to change as the manuscript develops.
